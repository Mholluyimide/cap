       <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">Bible Teaching</p>

       <p class="px-8">We believe that the Bible is the written and revealed Will of God.
        Man’s position to God, the way to obtain salvation, woe and destruction 
        awaiting sinners that refuse to repent and everlasting joy that is kept for 
         born again souls. All the Bible teachings are holy, what the Bible reveals as 
         the will of God are such that we should accept, and whatever God writes in the
          Bible and His Law are to remain unchangeable; for the Heavens and Earth may 
          pass away but the Word of God stands forever. Deut. 4:22; Rev. 22:18, 19; Matt. 24:34-38.
</p>

<div class="mt-3">
  <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">ABOUT GOD: Ps. 33:6-9</p>

  <p class="px-8">As revealed unto us by the Bible, we believe that there is only one God, Who is the Creator
     of both visible and invisible creatures -Gen. 1:1; Ps. 86:9-10; Is. 43:10-11; John 1:1-3.
      Only God will be in existence forever. Ez. 3:14; in God every creature receives life -John 5:26.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
  <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">ABOUT JESUS CHRIST</p>

  <p class="px-8">We believe that He is the Son of God; Who took away our sins, and the Savior of the world.
     We also believe that Jesus is God and was born by Mary the Virgin. He is God revealed in the flesh. 
     Through Him all things were created. John 1:1-14; John 14:9; Matt. 1:18-25, Is 9:6; Is 53:5-6. 
     We believe in His death on the Cross, and resurrection, by which He brought redemption
     – Is. 53:4-10; I Pet. 2:24; John 10:11; Gal. 3:13, Matt. 20:28; I Cor. 15:3; Rom. 4:25; 
     II Cor. 5:14; Heb 2:9; Heb 9:26.</p>
</div>
<div class="mt-3">
  <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT</p>

  <p class="px-8">The Holy Spirit is the third Person in the TRINITY. He has the same power, 
    the same glory with God the Father and God the Son – John 14:16-17; John 15:26;
     Matt. 3:16; Acts 13:24. He is one with Father and the Son who is to be worshiped and served. 
     Three Persons that become one are the source of blessings to all the living creatures in Heaven
      and on earth – Matt. 28:19; II Cor. 13:14; I John 1:5-7. The Holy Spirit has a great work to perform. 
      He Teaches, He Speaks to men, and bears witness in us – Acts 16:6-7; He performs the work of 
      regeneration for man- John 3:5-6; He also performs the work of Sanctification in the born again 
      souls until they are fully sanctified – John 16:8; Eph 1:17-19; II Thess. 2:13; I Cor. 6:11. 
      This same Holy Spirit endows believers with gifts they can use – I Cor 12:7; He empowers one in the Lord. Acts 1:8.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">ABOUT THE DEVIL</p>
    <p class="px-8">We believe that there is a devil, who seeks the down fall of every man. He brought sickness, 
        sin and death into the world. Gen. 3:1-16. He seeks the destruction of those who exercise their 
        faith in the Lord Jesus. Matt. 4:1-11; James 4:7; I Peter 5:8. The devil has several unclean spirits 
        over whom he governs – Matt. 12:24. A time would soon come when he shall be thrown into the pit and 
        chained for one thousand years- Rev. 20:7-9. After this, he will be put into the lake of fire where 
        he will remain suffering together with his followers for ever and ever. Rev. 20:10</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">REPENTANCE UNTO GOD</p>
    <p class="px-8">Repentance is the sorrow of a godly man for his sins with decision to abstain from them –
         Acts 3:19; 20:21; II Cor. 7:10; Mark 1:15; Is. 55:7; II Chron. 7:14; Ezek. 18:21.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">JUSTIFICATION OR NEW BIRTH</p>
    <p class="px-8">This is God’s grace whereby we are cleansed from our sins by which we are able to stand 
        before God as though we have never sinned. Acts 13:39; Rom. 3:25-26; Rom 5:1; I Cor. 6:11;
         Gal. 3:24; John 1:12-13; 3:3; II Cor. 5:9; Titus 3:5; I Peter 1:23; Acts 10:43; John 3:3,5.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">SANTIFICATION(HOLINESS)</p>
    <p class="px-8">Sanctification is another grace of God by which our souls are progressively and completely cleansed. 
        This is the second accomplishment of the grace which through our faith in the Blood of Jesus Christ 
        is wrought after we have been justified and free from our sins or regenerated – John 17:15-17;
         I Thess. 4:3; Heb. 2:11; 12:14; 13:12; I John 1:7; Luke 1:74, 75; II Cor. 7:1; I Peter 1:16; 
         Eph. 5:25-27; I Thess. 5:23-24; II Thess. 2:13.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">WATER BAPTISM</p>
    <p class="px-8">We believe in baptism by the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost – Matt. 28:19.
         The teaching is revealed in the New Testament and all Christians must obey this rule of
          the Lord – Acts 2:24; Acts 16:15; Acts 18:8; Acts 19:4-5. Every saved soul automatically 
          qualifies for Water Baptism – Acts 8:29-39; 16:18-23.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</p>

    <p class="px-8">All born-again souls should ask for the Holy Spirit from above, as the Apostles were ordered 
        to wait in Jerusalem until they were filled from above. It is the promise of the Father.
         It is God’s gift which He gives to those who obey Him – Luke 24:49; John 4:14-26; Acts 1:4-5; 
         Acts 5:32; Acts 8:14-17. </p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
<p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">ABOUT PRAYER</p>

<p class="px-8">A Christian without condemnation of heart has a right to thank God and be in adoration and in prayer
     unto the Lord always – Zek. 12:10. His soul thirsts for God – Ps. 42:2. The Holy Spirit helps his
      infirmities in prayer – Rom. 8:26. We must pray only by the Name of JESUS – John 16:23; ; I Tim. 2:25.
       Without faith our prayer shall be powerless before God – James 1:6-8; Heb. 11:6. Those who are unable 
       to pray annoy God – Is. 42:22; Is. 64:6-7. Much trouble and danger are encountered in the absence of
        prayer – Zeph 1:4; Dan 9:13-14; Hosea 8:13-14. We are commanded to pray and not to faint and to pray
         without ceasing – Col. 4:2; I Thess. 5:17; I Cor. 7:5; Luke 18:1. </p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">DIVINE HEALING</p>

    <p class="px-8">Healing without medicine is Biblical – Matt. 4:23; Ps. 103:3; Sickness is caused because of the fall of man.
         The force behind this is Satan – Job 2:1-9; Luke 13:15; Acts 10:3. But JESUS came to destroy the works of 
         the devil – I John 3:8. Christ purchased our soul from the curse of sin. He bore our infirmities and carried
          our sorrow – Matt. 8:15-17. By His stripes we are healed. Is 53:4-5; Gal. 3:13; I Peter 2:24. Healing without 
          medicine is of the Gospel – Matt. 9:35; Mark 6:10-18. We read that the twelve Apostles and the seventy disciples
           combined healing with their Ministry of the Gospel – Luke 9:1-2; Luke 10:1-9. The Lord commanded us to go into 
           the world, just to teach the nations alone, but that we should also heal the sick – Matt. 28:19-20; Mark 10:1,
            Mark 16:15-18.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">PROPHECY IN THE CHURCH</p>
    <p class="px-8">The Bible teaches us to abstain from all appearance of evil – I Thess. 5:22. “But follow after righteousness, 
        faith, love, purging ourselves from unclean things so that we may be vessels unto honor, sanctified, and 
        prepared unto every good work” – II Tim. 2:21-22. Therefore we must not see our Church members in dancing 
        halls, or cinema halls, reveling, for such things are works of the flesh. All people doing such things shall
         not inherit the kingdom of God – Gal 5:19-21; I Peter 4:3-4; Prov 31:4-5; Rev. 1:5-6; Gen 19:30-38.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">HOLY MATRIMONY</p>

    <p class="px-8">Marriage is honorable in all – Heb. 13:4. Therefore all members who wish to marry could do so in the church. 
        They are not to follow the worldly patter with drumming and dancing, drunkenness or wear clothes that:30-31; 
        I John 2:15-17; Rom. 12:2.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">PROPHECY IN THE CHURCH</p>

    <p class="px-8">We believe in all the prophecies in the Bible; likewise we believe that we can be given the gift of prophecy 
        by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit – I Cor. 14:29. Despise not prophesying – I Thess. 5:20. But any prophecy 
        that is against the Bible is rejected.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">HOLY COMMUNION</p>
    <p class="px-8">It is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ shortly before His death. He commanded all Christians to gather together 
        regularly to share the bread and wine till He comes back again – Luke 22:17-20; Matt. 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25;
         I Cor. 10:18, 21; Acts 2:42; 20:7; I Cor. 11:23-30.</p>
</div>

<div class="mt-3">
    <p class="text-2xl uppercase font-bold py-5 px-8">THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</p>
    <p class="px-8">The Second coming of Jesus Christ will be in physical form and will be visible to all in like manner as He was
         seen ascending up to heavens – Acts 1:9-11; John 14:3. His return will be in two stages:
          A. Christ’s return in the sky – The Saints or Bride of Christ will be raptured to meet Christ in the 
          sky – I Thess. 4:15-17; I Cor. 15:51-52; Matt. 24:40-44; Matt 25:10 B. His return to the earth – He
           will return to the earth to judge the sinners and the ungodly – Rev. 19:19-21; II Thess. 1:7-10; 
           Jude 1:14-15; Zech. 14:3-4.</p>
